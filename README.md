# Books Database ETL Pipeline

It's a web scrapping project to get the data of the books that are listed in an online bookstore bukabuku.com. Some of the data includes the title, author, language, pages, price of the book, etc. I built a simple pipeline with Airflow to automate the works from extracting data from the website, transform it, and store it to local postgresql database.
